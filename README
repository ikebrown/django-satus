Inspired by reading very good book "Two scoops of django" (Daniel Greenfeld and Audrey Roy) and watching series "Getting started with Django" (http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/) we created django project template that utilize great tools Vagrant, Puppet and uses project layout suggested in the book.

   file default.pp (puppet_provisioner/manifests/default.pp)

3. Edit local.py (project/your_project_name/configuration/settings/local.py). Enter database name and       
   password which you chose in $database_name, $password.

4. Run  vagrant up  from your project directory

5. Run vagrant ssh to enter guest machine
